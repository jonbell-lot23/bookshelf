## Training Models on Characters

Because things have been happening so quickly, itâ€™s fun to spot moments where things transition from obscure to well-understood. For many people, Andy Baioâ€™s post [Invasive Diffusion: How one unwilling illustrator found herself turned into an AI model][1] is when we first realised that it was possible to make your own personal model based on someone elseâ€™s work. Hereâ€™s the quick summary:

1. You can take about 16 images of something and make endless variations off the style.
2. This means any artist with a portfolio is in danger of having their style turned into a simple model that anyone can imitate.

It almost seemed too powerful and impressive to be true. You donâ€™t need thousands of images? You can get by with just 16? Well that changes everything, doesnâ€™t it?

Regardless of your feelings about this technology or how bad you feel for artists trying to make their living in a medium thatâ€™s going to start slipping through their fingers, itâ€™s natural to be curious. Is this really possible? How can someone do it? Can I do it myself? Overnight, several young startups were born, netting thousands of dollars of sales by providing a simple front-end to this impressive new technology. But a bunch of people tried to do it themselves instead. I was one of those people.

My favourite guide was written by Matt Haughey, who penned [Stable Diffusion and AI generated art is absolutely wild in every way][2]. He described a bunch of nerdy details about following [this video][3] to get everything working, but his images speak for themselves. Hereâ€™s him taking pictures of his face:

![]()

And hereâ€™s the output he got:

![]()
![]()
![]()

And of course thatâ€™s just for his own face.  You could do the same thing for the art style of Pixar, Dali, Banksy, sports mascots, tech logos, anything you want.
