## Stable Diffusion

While DALL-E and Midjourney tried to walk an ethical fine line, Stable Diffusion completely ignored it and plowed ahead. DALL-E and Midjourney banned pornography, racism, gore, and lots of other stuff. And because they acted as gatekeepers, there was no way around it. Want to post child porn? You can’t. Want to show a bunch of disturbing images of dead bodies? You can’t do that either. But Stable Diffusion wasn’t owned by any one company, so when they hit the scene, the ethical horse was let out of barn. If you can imagine something, Stable Diffusion will attempt to do it, with no rules.

Imagine working at a big company like Meta, Google, or Microsoft and being bound to really strict ethical codes of conduct. Imagine spending lots of time doing your research, crossing your t’s and dotting your i’s, and trying to navigate the complex worlds of content moderation, ethics, censorship, and so forth. Now imagine a company skipping past all of that stuff with an open-sourced product that can make anything, including child porn, on demand. It must have felt like working on the atom bomb and then watching everyone learn how to make an atom bomb in their backyard. And that’s where we are now.

Unsurprisingly, a bunch of really amazing innovations sprung up within a few hours. More kept coming over the next few days and weeks, and the community is really gathering steam. So yeah, Stable Diffusion can be used in really awful ways, but by putting the power in the hands of the public, a lot of cool ways have been illuminated as well. So many that it’s hard to even know where to begin.

In my case, I did get Stable Diffusion working on my computer, but it takes several minutes to make an image, despite my computer being really fast. And then the quality of the images was pretty low. Some people have hooked Stable Diffusion up to really powerful cloud computers and have spent a long time learning how to make really great prompts, but I haven’t quite gotten there yet.

Then, amongst all this frothy and exciting new content, the game changed again. People had broken through one of the most fundamental barriers to AI art — the inability to use the same character across two different pieces of art. Imagine asking for “A cyborg in a factory” for your first image and then “The same cyborg walking out of the same factory” for your second one. The machine doesn’t know what “the same cyborg” or “the same factory” are referring to, meaning AI art couldn’t be used for anything sequential.

But that was only a limitation for a few weeks. Now it’s absolutely possible, and it’s leading to yet another Cambrian explosion of new artistic ideas.
