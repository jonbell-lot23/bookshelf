I feel a bit blocked up right now, which doesn’t make much sense. If I start writing all the things I’m doing, it’s not going to seem like I’m blocked. But there’s a difference between doing lots of things and doing lots of things that you’re supposed to be doing. I’m in the former category.

So I’m tying to write Near Future Field Notes but I think it’s slipping away from me. The theme is “Rules for 2027” which was pretty inspiring at first. I wrote a bunch of things that I want people to keep in mind over the next five years, and I’ve ended up talking about mixed reality, which is something I’m really excited to talk about! And yet I wonder if the writing is cohesive. So I’m procrastinating a bit by writing this as a way to clear my mind.

Some other really big things have seen breakthroughs recently, including one of the most important ones at all: I have things automatically posting to GitHub and my two websites every night in the middle of the night! This is pretty great news and I’m really geeked about it.

Tech notes: it took launchd calling a shell script that pushes things automatically to GitHub, which automatically syncs to Vercel. It’s a pretty great process and it’s going to help a lot.

One trick that’s always helped me is taking a number and extrapolating from there to show progress. So for example if I want to write 1000 words, and after 3 days I’ve written 250 words, that’s 83 words per day. And that means it’ll take me 9 more days to hit my goal. I love seeing numbers like that because it helps motivate me to write more. There’s something fun about seeing the numbers go in the right direction. I should devote time to automating this math further, because the more motivating it is, the more I’ll write! And I like writing.

I think I am going to dive back into Near Future Field Notes now. I need to just power through my mixed reality stuff and see where it nets out. The editing process can come second. First I need a big chunk of content to work from. So here I go.
