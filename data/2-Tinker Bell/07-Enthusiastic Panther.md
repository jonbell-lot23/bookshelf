## Enthusiastic Panther
#### 23 June, 2022

I just found out that Enthusiastic Panther hasn’t played in 18 months! That’s nuts. And not ok. So I’m going to come up with a new setlist.

Ok, I posted a whole new tour throughout America, starting in Charlotte. And I did a fun thing where I had Enthusiastic Panther play in San Francisco on a night where I’ll be there. That’s fun :)
