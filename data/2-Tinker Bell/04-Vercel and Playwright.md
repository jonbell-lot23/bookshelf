## Vercel!
#### 12 June, 2022

I’ve known about Vercel for a long time but today I’m actually diving in to see how it works. Mostly because if I’m using Vercel I’ll be able to do E2E tests.

So I’m going to see if this works. (Reload) It works!

I spent the earlier part of the day learning Playwright, and I made some good progress. It felt good.  So as I understand more about the connection between GitHub \<-\> Vercel \<-\> E2E testing, I’ll be putting together a bunch of new skills that I’m hoping to master one day. Onward!
