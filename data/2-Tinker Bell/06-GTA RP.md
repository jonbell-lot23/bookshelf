## Grand Theft Auto 5 Role Playing
#### 22 June, 2022

I just discovered an incredible slice of the web that I want to learn more about.

First I found this guy from London who wanted to explore the game. He found a taxi driver who was amazing. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=xUCwHhYoqck][1] The whole 30 minutes blew me away.

So then I looked up the taxi driver. Turns out he’s this guy: [https://www.twitch.tv/AbdulHD][2]

Then I learned he’s part of a collective on a thing called NoPixel. And a surprising number of them are live right now. (Even though it’s the middle of the night in America) So I found someone called Kate:

And then I asked around. It went like this:

Me: I just found out about GTA RP, this is crazy!
Someone: Welcome. You have no idea, my friend.

So I asked about the nopixel server and apparently it has a pretty tough application process. Wow.

Here’s Kate’s character: [https://nopixel.fandom.com/wiki/Nancy\_Drew?so=search][4]

Here’s more info about Abdul: [https://nopixel.fandom.com/wiki/Abdul's\_Taxi\_Service?so=search][5]

This is nuts. I just loaded up the process for applying. Not sure if its working.
