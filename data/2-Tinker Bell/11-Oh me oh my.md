## Oh me oh my
#### (Not sure of the date — August 1?)

Oh, this is a really big day. I finally got permalinks working on this site, so now I can point to essays like this one. Before today, I’d have to say “Go to my website, then click this, then click this other thing” which isn’t great. But now it works, thanks to an assist from a person I met on reddit. Hurray!

I also inadvertently fixed another issue. It turns out I had been deploying incorrectly, but in a way I could only notice when I did dynamic URLs. So when I fixed the deploy issue for Bookshelf, I might have unblocked a bunch of other things at the same time. Which was pretty cool!

I also got a word count working on The Grand Library. As of today, I’ve written 1010819 words, which is pretty cool. And now I am motivated to write even more just to watch my numbers go up. So that’s fun.

But wait, there’s more!

I recently got sockets working, which is something I’ve wanted to get working for a few decades. Seeing it finally light up was a highlight in my entire coding career, because it opened up a whole bunch of new ideas that I never would have been able to touch before. My favourite idea is something I’m calling “Friend Flame” where you can click on a little flame to make it brighter, and your friend can see it happen in real time. That’s it. That’s the app.

I’ve also kicked off the next two Near Future Field Notes. I’m writing one called “Rules for 2027” and another one that will be an Artificial Intelligence Roundtable. Those should start popping in the next few weeks.

AND I recently got access to Dall-E, although I found that it wasn’t as interesting or fun as Midjourney, which was a surprise.

AND Spring83 is a thing I’d like to work with more.
