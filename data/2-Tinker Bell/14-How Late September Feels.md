**Cool thing #1: Bookshelf fixes**

I fixed bookshelf to have fixed width columns, which makes it look a lot nicer. Pretty wonderful.

**Cool thing #2: Writing more**

I’m not writing a *ton* but I am writing more recently. I’ve been using the writingprompts sub on reddit to come up with ideas and so far I’ve written three. Pretty cool.

**Cool thing #3: A chart to show my writing!**

Every night I check to see how much I wrote the night before. It’s very motivating to see the numbers go up, up up. 

**Cool thing #4: Big board came back**

I dusted off Big Board a few weeks ago, and maybe I’ll update it again shortly. It’s a fun project and I look forward to working on it more.

**Cool thing #5: Updated lot23.com**

Feeling pretty good about lot23.com! But I do need to continue updating it because it’s sort of half-done right now.

**Cool thing #6: Plebe 14 is coming!**

Plebe 14 is just about done and I’m pretty flipping thrilled about it. It’s a comics issue and it turns out I’m pretty good at comics, actually.

**Cool thing #7: Writing music**

I’m writing music again! That’s pretty neat. Stay tuned.

**Cool thing #8: Top secret project**

I’m excited enough about this that I don’t want to talk about it. Shh.

**Cool thing #9: Near Future Field Notes!**

I have six weeks to turn around another Near Future Field Notes and I’m feeling excited about it.

Lots of cool things! Onward!
