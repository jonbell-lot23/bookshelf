## The other things on my mind
#### 13 June, 2022

I’ve been writing about a lot of work projects, plus my Board and Bookshelf projects, but I’ve got a lot of other things going on too! Let’s talk about them.

### Storyboard Comics

I’ve been drawing out very low fidelity comics and having a great time with them. Like, barely stickman level. The sort of thing that’s providing a general sense of a storyboard without putting any effort into the actual quality of the drawing. 

It occurred to me the other day that I could publish these crappy comics as-is. Get the dialog and story working, keep the quality of the drawings very minimal, and ship it the way they are. That could be fun.

### Lifestyle comics

I love Guy Delisle’s style of comics. The drawings are extremely simple but he weaves together really great vignettes about his life experiences. I adore his approach, and it’s unsurprising that it reminds me of Lost In Translation, my favourite movie. Snippets of life woven together. You can inject that into my veins. And I’d like to see if I can do the same thing for others. I have some good stories to tell.

### Hiring an illustrator

I recently read “Algeria is Beautiful Like America” and really enjoyed it. More importantly, I noticed that the touching personal story was written by the writer, but the drawings were done by a second person, an illustrator. I’ve hired illustrators in the past, but I’ve never found a partner that I could do an entire comic with. That would be amazing if I could do it.

### Plebe 14

My next issue of Plebe goes live in a few months. The general theme is me talking about things I don’t know much about. I really need to buckle down and get those pieces written.
