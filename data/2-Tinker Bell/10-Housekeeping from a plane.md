## Housekeeping FROM A PLANE
#### 15 July, 2022

I just made a small change to address something that’s been bugging me for a while. It’s funny how small the change was, and what a big deal it will be. But that’s what happens when you build little skills over time, they build into something bigger and maybe even useful!

So here’s the big problem. I had two directories for content, which meant duplication between the two places. One area was called The Grand Library, which catalogs all of my written content over the years. The other area was called Bookshelf, which is probably where you’re reading this very content. So let’s say I want to write this article, but also include it in The Grand Library? For a while I was making a copy and dragging it into a new directory. That’s dumb, not to put too fine a point on it.

So today I made “Bookshelf” a subdirectory of “The Grand Library” and wrote a little script to copy files between the two folders each time I publish. Easy cheesy. And now I am going to try my publish command. If you read this on the internet, then yay! My code worked!
