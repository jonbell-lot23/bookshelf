#### 13 July, 2022

**SSR Example**  
Wasn’t able to get this working. Iced.

**Do the thing**  
Very simple, but it’s up and running at [http://do-the-thing-opal.vercel.app][1].

**The Grand Library**  
Up and running, including with tests! Exciting.

**Enthusiastic Panther**  
Tour is happening, but I’m still stuck on dynamic URLs. (See SSR example)

**Routing/permalinks**  
Same as EP and SSR example.

**Crate Digger**  
Stalled out. Would be cool to work with objects and messaging. (Like highlight everything that’s of property x)

**Board**  
Haven’t updated in a few days but it’s pretty cool.

**Bookshelf**
Pretty happy with it, but not the lack of permalinks/routing.

**Spring 83**
I figured out heroku, so maybe that means I can get this working?

**Here comes my trip!**

I’ve got some things on my mind that I’d like to sort out. First, I recently looked through my files and discovered my Long Talk rounds 1 through 3. They’re SO GOOD. I’m sort of flabbergasted by how good they are. I want to kick off round 4, I want to publish the old ones, I want to yell from the rooftops.

But what I should really do is massage the data from round 3 while I figure out what to do with them. There’s a fair amount of good work to do here, and I should. Putting that content together might help me figure out how round 4 should work. But we’ll see.

The next Near Future Field Notes will be the throwback issue, the one that William narrated. So that gives me some space, and then the next thing to work on is Plebe. So I might as well do an issue on The Long Talk. Right? That seems like an obvious and good idea.

I’ve been playing with Nintendo’s Game Builder Garage game. It’s really fun. I’ve also been working with William to think through how gaming might work and how I might want to approach it. I should keep playing Nintendo Game Builder and go from there. (or whatever it’s called)
