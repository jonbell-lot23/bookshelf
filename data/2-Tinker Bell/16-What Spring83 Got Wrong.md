## 16-What Spring83 Got Wrong

I admit that I chose a title that sounds needlessly aggressive and negative, mostly as a way to organise my thoughts. A more accurate title might be something like “I am really inspired by Spring83 but now I will see if I can come up with some better ideas on top of it.” I should also point out that I love when Robin Sloan comes up with ideas. I invariably find them exciting and inspiring. And his wrap up of what he learned out of Spring83 was no exception. I am bursting with ideas! So here they are.

**Spring83 makes you host stuff**

No one wants to host things. Sure, nerds do. Sure, cutting-edge protocol following folks do. Sure, people on Robin Sloan’s mailing list do. Sure, I do.

But that represents about zero percent of the population. Any idea that requires someone to fork something or have their own webserver will fail, full-stop.

But let’s talk about what “failure” means. Do you fail if only 100 people use something? I don’t think so. Do you fail if zero people use something after initially kicking the tires? Yes, I do believe that’s a failure. And if you make people host things, you will fail. So that’s issue number one. The product/experience can’t rely on your ability or desire to host things.

Robin made reference to this, but I want to underline it and circle it. People need a way to get into a groove with a product. Which means holding their hands through the initial setup. Which means hosting. It never won’t mean that.

**It’s trying too hard not to be a timeline**

Let me explain my timeline-hating bona fides. I worked at Twitter on disinformation. I have left social media. I have a pretty small digital footprint overall. I am deeply concerned about all of these issues, and if I may be so bold, I know a fair amount about them. I even started a non-profit for dealing with harassment and abuse. So it’s never far from my mind. I’m anti-timeline.

But let’s just be honest about human beings — they’re not interested in manually typing URLs in address bars to check up on their favourite sites. They’re not interested in maintaining a bunch of bookmarks. They’re not interested in sifting through their inbox. Here’s what they want: interesting content a thumb swipe away.

And I’m not saying that in a “let’s just all give up” way. I’m not saying the people have spoken and there’s nothing we can do about it. I’m saying something much more nuanced but also really exciting because of how well-scoped it is: you need to present content with as little friction as possible. Want to bring more nutrition to people’s information diet? Great. Show me how you can do it with a timeline, or you won’t succeed. That’s the bar to hit. It just is.

**@mentions matter because people like to communicate**

Robin referred to this as well. Having zero way to communicate with other people causes a lot of friction. If you hosted a dinner party but everyone was in a different room, and you could only talk to each person via Loom, but only one person at a time, but oops the time delay on the Loom was ten minutes, you wouldn’t have a dinner party anymore. You’d have an art project. And that’s fine. Once.

**Blue sky thinking isn’t a license to ignore human behaviour**

It drives me crazy when people encourage Big Bold Blue Sky Thinking and forget who they’re dealing with. Humans don’t want to do things that are hard, so your incentives better be super great, enough to justify the work. Humans don’t like to be told what to do. Humans prefer sugar and fat to healthy stuff. It’s not that they’re evil, it’s just that it takes a lot effort to be a model citizen. So anything that requires humans to act perfectly is going to fail.

Would it be great if people only used media to enrich themselves in ways that directly moved humanity forward? Sure. But do most people use most media just to feel good after having a tough day? Yeah. So when we think big about what the future might look like, you better have a damn good reason to make people work for things, or else they won’t do it. I find this really inspiring! Build a better mousetrap, don’t just say “well in my world, there’s not a mouse problem.”

Face the reality of the issue and then you can make something better. Here’s the reality: people like to fiddle with their phones. Twitter let them fiddle with text. Instagram was more pleasing because it let them fiddle with images. And then TikTok blew everyone away by showing the world’s most amazing personalised TV channel the world has ever seen.

Bonus points for trying, but if you can’t be more interesting than TikTok, and you’re off by a factor of, I dunno, a TRILLION, you might be misreading the spec.

**Putting it all together**

Designers are often asked to answer the question “what’s the problem we’re trying to solve?” and before that step it’s useful to contextualise the problem space with insights. Here are some:

* Timelines are full of garbage
* Abuse and harassment is a real issue
* Having a centralised place for moderation causes issues
* People love seeing content that is relevant to them
* Video/images seem more compelling than text

And I do agree with Robin when he says you don’t just want to reinvent a plain ol’ timeline, Animal Farm style. That’s fine. But you need to figure out why what you’re offering will actually be valuable to humanity, and not just be an academic exercise. So? What’s the problem we’re trying to solve? We could pick from a few:  

1. A better timeline (something Robin strenuously rejects)
2. A beautiful new way to express yourself online

**How can we provide a beautiful new way to express yourself online?**

Let’s skip the first one. Let’s just say that TikTok and everyone else has cracked that nut and no other protocol has anything meaningful to add to it. Clearly the future is in awesome timeline content, so if we don’t want to make a timeline we’ll just abandon that altogether. So how might we express ourselves online in a new way?

We already have blogs. If you don’t want to host one yourself, you can use Medium, Wordpress, you name it.

We already have email newsletters. If you don’t want to host one yourself (you don’t), you can use Mailchimp or Substack or whatever.

We already have Dribbble, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, and so forth. We also have places for hosting portfolios. All of those exist.

So what are we really talking about? A better timeline? The return of gopher? A component people can put on their personal websites that provides a calling card or something? Are we just trying to make a protocol in the interest of making a protocol? Is that it?

**I have some ideas**

But they’ll have to wait for another time.
