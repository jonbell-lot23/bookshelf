## Readme

“Tinker, Bell” is a blog I’ve run in different forms for a while, and now I’m going to kick it off again! Hello!  

Think of this as a workman’s journal. This lets me understand what projects are in flight, what their status is, and what sorts of things I’m working through. I write it for myself, but it can sometimes be interesting for other people to read.

Enjoy!
