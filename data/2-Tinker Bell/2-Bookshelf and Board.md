## Bookshelf and Board 
#### 12 June, 2022

I have two major projects in flight right now, Bookshelf and Board.

### Bookshelf
Bookshelf (which you’re probably reading right this very minute!) is a three-pane blog. On the far left, I show all the projects I’m currently working on. On the second pane I show all the posts. And on the right pane I write the article. Great. (Break to eat some cake)

The next things I want to do with bookshelf:

* Auto-commit and deploy
* It would be nice to make it work on mobile
* It’d be great to show selected states
* Permalinks is a stretch goal

None of these are necessary to do today.

### Board
Board is a way to show my latest work in a visual format, sort of like a big pinboard diary. There are a few things I want to do here:

* Automatically commit everything to github
* Automatically find old items and pixelate them
* Automatically delete old items
* I should probably compress stuff too

Today I’d just be happy to automatically commit them to github. The delete/automation stuff can come later. Same with the compression.

### Update

* Board now auto-commits to GitHub, and I deleted some stuff
* Bookshelf now has an alias that auto-commits and deploys
  
High five, me!

(Although my typography is still all messed up, so I need to address that soon)
