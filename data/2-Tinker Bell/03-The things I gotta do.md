## The Things I Gotta Do
#### 12 June, 2022

I love writing journals like this because it keeps me driving forward and motivated. So what do I need to do next?

I’d like to do the auto-pixelation and auto-deletion scripts for The Big Board. With that in hand, I can pretty much call that project ready to go. Sure, I’d like a nicer favicon and a better header … but those aren’t as important as making sure it’s able to run all by itself. It’s sort of like an ecosystem in a bottle!

So I’m gonna do that.

(Time passes)

Ok! The automatic pixelation works now and I’m thrilled! Today I did everything right. Time to go to bed now :)
