I do best when I have a goal I’m working towards, and lately it feels like I don’t have a goal to work towards. So I came up with a simple app idea.

1. At the top there’s a question that says DID YOU DO CREATIVE WORK TODAY?
2. Below that, it either says YES or NO and that’s the entire website.

That’s it. I think even that amount of goal-setting and gamification will help me to feel proud of the work that I do and keep me ticking along creatively. It’s silly how easy the plan is, and how transparently it will motivate me. I’m looking forward to working on that.

What’s funny is I’ve actually been doing a ton of things. It’s just that my lack of documentation is making me feel like I’m twisting in the wind. 

**Teaching my son to code**  
My 14 year-old asked me to “force” him into writing code. He was having trouble with motivation, so I told him he wasn’t allowed to watch TV with mom and dad if he didn’t do an hour of code each night. It worked! He’s done all sorts of cool things since, and I’ve been helping.

He’s doing a lot of work with a neighbour on his website, which means he needs to react to client requests. This is great for boning up on practical skills and client relationships. He even made his first invoice a few days ago!

**Test suites**  
I’m pretty excited about this one. I never really understood how test suites worked before, so I’ve been pouring time into learning how they work and aiming them at my personal projects. Right now I have things running hourly to make sure my websites are all reachable. It’s a good first test.

I also learned how to connect to my bank, log in, and grab my balance. Connecting is easy, logging in is surprisingly easy, but actually grabbing the balance is a bit beyond my skills right now. I could take a screenshot I guess, but that’s not what I want. I just want to return a number like $531.21 that I can use elsewhere in code. So I am going to figure that out next.

Speaking of screenshots, there are a lot of things I’d like to do here. The first one is directly applicable to my day job — I want to take a screenshot of our software once a day or week to track the changes to the product over time. I’ll be working on that tomorrow.

**Painting project**
I spent some time taking Midjourney visuals and trying to recreate them as paintings on my iPad. I did four. I’m not very good at them yet but it’s a really fun exercise. I think I’m going to do it more. My daughter has started as well!

**Fixed my giant library of writing**
My docasaurus installation was broken and I fixed it. I also used testing to make sure it doesn’t break again. Feeling pretty good about that.

**Reconciling The Grand Library and Bookshelf**
Right now it’s possible to have a file in one location, the other location, or both. It’s not a good state. Eventually I’d like to reconcile these so they’re all reading from a single location. Otherwise a lot of things are going to continue to go awry.

**Summary**
* I’ve done a lot of things
* Test suites is my next big focus at work
* Reconciling is my next personal project chore
* Painting and writing is my fun project
* I’ve been enjoying Factorio as a side project

**Late-breaking news**
