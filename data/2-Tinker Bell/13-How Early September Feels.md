Ok! I shipped Near Future Field Notes. I also made a wonderful nightly script to track how many words I’m writing every day. That’s going to go a long way to keeping me motivated, and has already borne fruit.

That said, I have Covid. I got it about a week ago and I’m feeling pretty much over it by now. But it’s been a tough few weeks of feeling cabin fevery and low. 

(Then I got pulled away and never finished this journal entry. Let’s try again!)

#### 4 September, 2022

It’s a new day! Yesterday I tested negative on my Covid test, and now all three of the kids are going to school for a full week! That’s a big deal and it’s been a long time coming. It’s nice being on the other side of the Covid illness, and what great timing. Spring is coming, I’m going to play futsal tomorrow, and things are rolling forward. All exciting!  

That said, I’m also feeling pretty low. I think part of it is stress at work. In fact, all of it might be stress at work. I work at a startup and we’re trying to raise money. Raising money is stressful. Imagining what happens if we can’t raise money is stressful. Wondering about layoffs is stressful. It’s all stressful, and it’s what I signed up for.

Time will provide clarity. But as of today, it’s Monday and my US coworkers won’t be online until Wednesday, since it’s Labour Day for them. So I have this interesting gap of two days to get my thoughts in order before everyone comes back. And it’s important that I get things straight so I can do a good job when they return.

The way to do that is to prioritise our NUX v2 project. What will make the biggest impact? From there, what do we have agreement on, and what do we still need to discuss? From there, what are the best assets/ways of communication that will help push things forward?
