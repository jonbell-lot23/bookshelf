## 7-We’ve Always Dreamed of Smart Computers

I’m not particularly animated by the concept of AI, because it’s always existed. Computers that get super smart, maybe one day as smart as us, then smarter, blah blah blah. My attitude for a long time was “wake me when it’s here.”

I enjoyed reading Stranger in a Strange Land when I was younger. In it, a computer becomes self aware. It stuck with me that of all the things the omniscient computer could do, the one thing it couldn’t quite figure out what humour. It couldn’t understand what was funny and what wasn’t.

In 2010, the Twitter account horse\_ebooks came online and immediately became a viral sensation. Many of the tweets were garbage spewed out from a random word generator, but sometimes it hit on Zen-like gold such as

> "Everything happens so much"

Following that account and seeing people’s reaction to it felt like one of the first moments when I felt the power of AI instead of it being theoretical. This wasn’t Terminator Two, Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick’s AI, Data from Star Trek,  or anything out of science fiction. It wasn’t talking about the singularity, and it wasn’t talking about the future. It was a Twitter account that I could visit today, right now, and get inspired by.

The first thing I noticed is what they teach artists in art school, magicians in magic school, and businessmen in business school. The human mind is so good at pattern recognition and anthropomorphism that you don’t need to work very hard to fool people. Give them enough to get their mind filling in the blanks and you can get them caring about anything.

There’s an old IDEA ad where someone leaves a lamp on the sidewalk, and between the music, the pacing, the camera placement, and the composition of the shot, you feel bad for the lamp. But then a narrator helpfully appears and says “Why do you care about this lamp? It has no feelings!” Yet we want to attach meaning and feelings to everything. Which is why when horse\_ebooks says “avoid situations,” we don’t think it’s two random words that happen to sound good together, we suspect maybe there’s a ghost in the machine.

There’s not, of course. But it’s fun to think there is.

In 2016, Robin Sloan wrote a post called [Writing with the machine][1] where he showed off a new AI-based writing tool. His software let you press a button when reaching for the right word or phrase, then an AI assistant would return something hopefully good. But the software wasn’t randomly spewing words like horse\_ebooks, it was trained on actual science fiction texts. It was meant as a writer’s assistant, not a writer in its own right.

I remember that dismissive line about “dead-eyed robo-text” and thinking “hey wait a second, hipster. You might be done with dead-eyed robot-text, but I want to play around with some!”

So I installed the software to get his code running, thought it was really cool, then I dove in to making my own models. It was a lot of fun. I’d pull down every word I’ve ever written, do a bunch of magic incantations, then watch it spit out horse\_ebooks-style phrases at me. But they’d all have the general feel of something I’d actually write. It was amazing.

I quickly tried other sets of data. Every rap lyric by Kanye West. Every tweet from my fellow Twitter co-workers. A blend of every rap song I could find with my co-workers’ tweets, although I remember a friend saying “Remember there are some things in rap songs I would NEVER say.” Good point. I had been publishing some of the funniest mash-ups in Twitter bots, but realised anything with the n-word was best left unpublished.

I’ll talk more about these explorations later, but this was my first “day trip” into the canyon of real machine learning, on my own computer, doing little projects I was dreaming up. It wasn’t a distant future, it was a tool in my own toolbox that I could explore whenever I wanted. That’s when AI started really feeling like something. Still a far cry from robot butlers and Philip K Dick novels, but something. Just a little something to have some fun with. I started thinking about it more, not as a future concept but as a contemporary creativity tool.

And of course I wasn’t the only one. Not by a long shot.
