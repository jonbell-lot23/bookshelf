## 8-Midjourney

I had dozens of little side trips on my AI journey, from a series of essays from Wait But Why to Max Tegmark’s book Life 3.0 to the paperclips web game. And I’ll talk about each of those in due course, but let’s jump instead to present day. I want to talk about Midjourney, and how it moved the AI conversation from an abstract and futuristic theory to something that could delight me right now. 

Looking through my notes, I see I was exploring DALL-E and Midjourney in April 2022. Enthusiast communities sprung up for showcasing the best work. At that point, very few people had access, so most people were left to make requests that kind DALL-E subscribers would fulfil. I spent some time looking on Twitter to see individual artists posting their own explorations, and a few DMs to them went un-answered.

Somewhere along the way, I saw that someone had saved about 1000 DALL-E URLs, so I spent a few hours scraping them so I could sort through and find the best ones. I made a huge Figma document where I could label them, and I could hardly believe what I was seeing. The novelty of being able to type “a frog riding a bike” wore off pretty soon. I was more excited about the art that people were able to create with it. I wanted to be one of those early pioneers, but I still didn’t have access.

Eventually I sent an email to someone who did have an invite to give, so all of a sudden I had access to Midjourney. I spent weeks playing around with it, and soon after that I got access to DALL-E as well. I’ll go into more detail later, but the summary is that the technology blew me away, as did the community, documentation, and everything else about the experience. I was a bit let down by WALL-E but that didn’t matter, because Midjourney was so dang impressive.

It was around this time where I started seeing a lot of discussion around the ethics of all this work. Was it fair that artists were having their work pulled down and thrown into a giant model? Was it fair that artists could enter AI art into competitions and beat traditional artists? What about making models based on certain illustrators? All good questions, none with easy answers.
  
But then came Stable Diffusion, which rendered a lot of questions moot.
