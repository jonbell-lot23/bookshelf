## I Don’t Like

I don’t like when people say humanity is stupid. I think that’s one one of the stupidest things we say, in fact. Humans made everything we find novel and interesting. We didn’t make the mountains, the galaxy, water, and other basics like that. But we did figure out a way to make the pyramids, the internet, and a cure for cancer. That’s fucking brilliant. We forget that. We’re surrounded by so much brilliance I think we lose touch of just how impressive it all is.

And I get it. When humanity does something we don’t like, it’s easy to say it’s because humans are stupid or disappointing. But there’s so much more interesting stuff to discover if you scratch beneath the surface. Why do people join cults? Is it because they’re just stupid? Maybe for some people, but that doesn’t fully explain the phenomenon. No, it’s because we like being around people that make us feel like we belong. That’s a much more interesting vein to mine for insight, isn’t it?

Or what about when people vote for someone we don’t personally like? It’s easy to say it’s because the other side was just a uniformed, drooling moron. But a more likely result is that, on average, the voters that voted with you are just as smart as the people who voted against you. And that the candidate who won had a better overall message. That’s it. I don’t like when we think not getting our way in a democracy is some giant conspiracy and the death of everything we hold near. It’s better to think about the alternative — never getting who you voted for, because you’re living in an autocracy. Careful what you wish for.
