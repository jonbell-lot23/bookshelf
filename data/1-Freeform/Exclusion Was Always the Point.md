## Exclusion Was Always the Point

Exclusion is a bad word, so no one wants to think they’re contributing to it. When you hear that a group of kids excluded someone, you side with the outcast over the group. When someone says you’re being exclusionary, your immediate reaction is probably defensiveness. Exclusion is bad. Right?

I’m not so sure it always is. When you decide to have a coffee date with one person at the cozy café down the block, you’re excluding the rest of your friend group by design. A one-on-one chat has a different feel than five people talking, or twenty people talking, or trying to talk to a stadium arena from the stage in between songs. We sometimes choose small spaces, we sometimes choose big spaces. And when we pick something intimate, it is by definition more exclusionary.

I was on the internet pretty early on, and I experienced the waves of new users (the first time I heard the word “newbie”) and the consternation it caused. Back then it was really hard to get online, so the first people at the party tended to be server administrators. They tended to be nerds. They tended to love dungeons and dragons. They tended to have bushy beards. They tended to be men. And a real community grew out of that, since so many people were so similar to one another.

Sure, we had women, people who didn’t study computer science in school, who didn’t write code or do security for a living, who didn’t attend Renaissance Faires, or listen to electronic music. But, to be clear, even if you managed to be an exception to the stereotype, you were probably married to one, or dating one, or dating more than one! Nerds love polyamory, after all. So that was another thing over-represented from the start.

A funny thing happens when a bunch of outcasts discover fellow outcasts. They bond pretty deeply. And then a sad thing happens when other people from the mainstream attempt to join in – they get rejected. The early web was full of communities, whether they were into leatherworking, glassblowing, Kraftwerk, or PC gaming, who emphasised exclusion over openness. Part of it is based on culture driven via keywords, where everyone knows what to expect when visitiing alt.music.gratefuldead or performing a search for the term “furries.” But there’s another force at play: exclusion by design. Gatekeeping.

But that’s another insulting word, one that no one thinks they do. Is it really “gatekeeping” when you don’t invite that one annoying person from class because no one really likes them? Is it exclusionary when you set a seating chart at a wedding to make sure everyone has a dinner partner they get along with? Maybe, but it’s also completely understandable. And it was understandable when the original protonerds of the early web got frustrated by all the normies from AOL flooding into their online digital spaces. Ones who had their own interests, like Garth Brooks, hockey, or Brazilian politics.

And so, understandably, the growth of our digital online communities meant a further fracturing. Suddenly it was no longer a safe assumption that someone with a modem necessarily wrote code, painted Warhammer figurines, loved anime, and thought Madonna sucked. Suddenly the actual world, with an infinite number of opinions, preferences, and tastes crashed the cozy online world, and it took some getting used to.

(And I’m not even going to get into the Star Wars folks fighting with the Star Trek folks, or the old deadheads fighting with the new deadheads, or Mac versus PC religious wars, or any of the other active wars happening within and across sub-communities. That’s a whole other topic.)

Now it’s happening again over on Mastodon. The difficulty of getting the app working, combined with the very small population on its servers, meant the only people who stuck around were, well, classic nerd types and early adopters. Using Mastodon as a mainstream user has always been like walking through a small town after 8pm. Sure, there are a few things going on, but you tire of them quickly. That changed this week, when hundreds of thousands of people left Twitter to try Mastodon. So now more things are going on, and the original community is mourning the intimacy of what has been lost. As they’re allowed to. But I think they’re misunderstanding a lot of things.

First, I think people keep forgetting that consumers want two things from their products. One, they want the product to do a good job. And two, they want the product with as little friction as possible. A vacuum cleaner that does everything right yet costs too much money is an example of too much friction. Whereas a vacuum cleaner at the right cost but bad at its job is an example of too little quality. Simple, right? So let’s aim that at social media.

If you want to flip open an app and see “good content,” the app needs to know what good means. Maybe for one person it means political news. For someone else it might mean sports analysis. Maybe another person wants cool links. Perhaps another is looking for book recommendations. Everyone is different and it’s really tough to design a system that works for everyone.

Some people have been able to fine-tune the list of people they follow to get a good signal-to-noise ratio. But they’re rare. The data I saw about five years ago said that it takes 2-3 years to get to a healthy state, where health is defined by “decides to keep using the app.” The data is pretty clear – if you want people to use the app, you need to present them with good stuff. To present them with good stuff, you need datapoints. To get those datapoints, you need to … do something.

Mastodon has been successful by catering people who actively want to build their follow lists. Who want to spend time poking around to find something good. And they exist, of course. But they’re not most people. The system works because it’s exclusionary by default. So how might we combine the intimacy of Mastodon with the reach and power of something like TikTok, Facebook, or Twitter?

You make TikTok, Facebook, or Twitter. I’m serious.

Let’s say 99% of the world hates eating sand, but 1% loves it for some reason. You can open a restaurant called The Sand Dune and cater to the 1%. They might not be large in number, but because it’s an exclusive club, it’s able to be more intimate and special. There are a lot of problems with eating sand, but these people will put up with it because they’ve self-selected into this group.

Meanwhile, the other 99% are asking for restaurants that don’t make you eat sand. And that’s a much harder challenge. You need to handle all of humanity, not just one little slice of it. You need to provide options. You need to cater to everyone’s needs, which takes time and effort.
