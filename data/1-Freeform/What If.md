## What If

What if the people working at Apple actually did believe in everything they say about protecting privacy, putting the user first, and so forth? What if the people at Meta really did think it was important to bring people together, and saw themselves as bringing forward a whole new kind of communication? What if (third example)? And what if they’d believe that even if their salaries were cut in  half, or removed altogether? Because that’s where we are.
