## Goodbye, Finally

I’ll start with the broad brushstrokes first, then we’ll get into the details. I had a friend named Klorida. We became close friends, and intense writing partners. After several years of being coworkers and friends, she told me we couldn’t talk anymore, which was very difficult. I’ve always wondered what went wrong, and now I think I’m finally ready to say goodbye. But now the details.

When someone tells you they don’t want to talk anymore, it’s because you did something wrong or because they’re dealing with something on their end. In Klorida’s case, there are two obvious culprits: I was being clingy and annoying or she was told by her husband that we couldn’t communicate anymore. Maybe both were true. But I spent years realising that it really doesn’t matter.

Imagine being overweight your entire life, then someone breaking up with you because you’re not compatible. You’d wonder if it was because of your physical appearance, since that’s your main insecurity. And that’s how I feel about Klorida and our relationship. I’ve always assumed I was annoying to people, so when a close friend disappeared, I figured I had finally done it. I had scared away a perfectly good friend by being a garbage person. And to be clear, it’s entirely possible this actually happened. People drift away, even from people who aren’t annoying or clingy.

But there are other details that I can see more clearly after all these years. Like the fact that she had a controlling husband. Or the fact that he stated if he ever suspected she was being unfaithful, he’d just disappear and she or the kids would never see him again. There are other stories here that all point to the same thing: they did not have a happy marriage, neither was thrilled about it, and jealousy ran deep within him. So that’s worth adding as well. It’s possible, or even likely, she had to stop talking to me because of something he said or did. Potentially annoying friend and highly jealous husband adds up to us having to stop talking all those years ago.

But there was another detail, one that doesn’t change the main story but does help me contextualise our entire relationship. She reached out a few years ago, after years of silence. She was going to come to New Zealand, and she missed the way we used to talk. She wondered if I had any thoughts about the team she would soon be joining at Microsoft. I said hello, it was nice to hear from her, I didn’t have much to say about her new team, and then I asked her why she disappeared all those years ago. She dodged the question. So I asked again.

I used the term “once bitten, twice shy” and that put her into a rage. She told me she wouldn’t make the mistake of reaching out to me again. I felt relief that she blew up at me, because it helped me to realise how unhealthy the relationship must have always been. A smart, energetic, creative woman shared herself with me. We wrote literally hundreds of thousands of words to each other in just a few months. We were each other’s creative inspiration for a glorious few years. I have lots of stories where she is supportive, and caring, and my best friend during a tumultuous time. But then we have her rage email, where I asked for more details about her painful exit.

I can make peace with the idea that we may have drifted apart. Or that I might have been an annoying or otherwise inferior friend. I can understand that her jealous husband certainly didn’t help anything. And I can see her angry response to me more clearly now. As desperately as I wanted her to love me as much as I loved her, and as much as I needed to be told what happened all those years ago, you can’t always get what you want. And she is an entirely other person now. I knew someone a decade ago who isn’t the same person anymore. People change. And I may be ready to fully say goodbye.
