## Goodbye, Finally

I’ll start with the broad brushstrokes first, then we’ll get into the details. I had a friend named Klorida. We became close friends, and intense writing partners. After several years of being coworkers and friends, she told me we couldn’t talk anymore, which was very difficult. I’ve always wondered what went wrong, and now I think I’m finally ready to say goodbye. But now the details.

When someone tells you they don’t want to talk anymore, it’s because you did something wrong or because they’re dealing with something on their end. In Klorida’s case, there are two obvious culprits: I was being clingy and annoying or she was told by her husband that we couldn’t communicate anymore. Maybe both were true. But I spent years realising that it really doesn’t matter.

Imagine being overweight your entire life, then someone breaking up with you because you’re not compatible. You’d wonder if it was because of your physical appearance, since that’s your main insecurity. And that’s how I feel about Klorida and our relationship.
